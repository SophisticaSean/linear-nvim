# Linear plugin for NeoVim

## The problem
You're working on a project where issues are managed in [Linear](https://linear.app/karma-horizons). 
You want to browse issues assigned to you, read their description and copy the git branch name, all from within 
NeoVim using keyboard shortcuts. In addition, you want to be able to quickly create issues, also from within your
editor. These are the usecases linear-nvim is designed for.

## Installation
* neovim 0.8.0+ required
* Install using your favorite plugin manager. I'm using lazy.nvim in this case
* You will need `nvim-lua/plenary.nvim` and `nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim` installed
   * The former is used for making http requests while the latter is used to show query results and make selections 
  
```lua
return {
  {
    "rmanocha/linear-nvim",
    dependencies = {
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
      "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    },
    config = function()
      require("linear-nvim").setup()
    end,
  },
}
```

## Configuration
TBD

## Usage
There are only two primary use cases supported as of now
* You can fetch the 50 most recent issues assigned to you, search through the title/identifier of each of them, read it's description and copy the git branch of any one
* You can create a new issue - only providing a title is supported as of now
  * Description is in the works, as soon as I can figure out how to send it successfully via the graphql API 

### Getting an API Key

Only supported authentication method is using the [Linear Personal API keys](https://developers.linear.app/docs/graphql/working-with-the-graphql-api#personal-api-keys). 
You will be prompted to provide it the first time (post installation) the plugin tries to query the Linear API.

#### Storage of the API Key

We store the API key you provide in a plaintext file in `vim.fn.stdpath("data")`. You can always delete it there. Alternatively, you can simply revoke the key from Linear itself, if/when needed.

### Keymaps

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>mm", function()
  require("linear-nvim").show_assigned_issues()
end)
vim.keymap.set("v", "<leader>mc", function()
  require("linear-nvim").create_issue()
end)
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>mc", function()
  require("linear-nvim").create_issue()
end)
```

## Roadmap

* Provide configuration options
  * Change the default behavior from copy to something else (eg. open in browser)
  * Pull more than 50 issues when trying to list them
  * Add a default tag when creating new issues
  * Filter down listed issues to a specific team
* Integrate with a git plugin to automatically create the new branch (does lazygit support this?)
* Add support to provide a description for newly created issues
* Integrate with [folke/todo-comments.nvim](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim) to create issues from TODOs
* Build a viewer to be able to see title, description etc. when hovering over a Linear issue identifier
* Add tests
